# Invoice.build app development
This repo is a high-level repo for setting up the development environment for the [invoice.build](https://invoice.build) app and all it's dependent services.

## Getting started
Clone this repo and move into the newly created directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Invoice-build/app-dev.git invoice-build && cd invoice-build
```

Initiate the submodules and make sure they're up to date.
```bash
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

Set up the api database and seed it with the supported tokens.
```bash
docker-compose build && docker-compose run api rails db:setup
```

Add your own environment credentials to the api service. To do this run the following to create and open the development credentials file in vim:
```bash
docker-compose run api rake creds:prod
```

Then paste the follow in the file and add your credentials:
```yaml
jwt_secret: 
etherscan:
        api_key: 
infura:
        project_id: 
        project_secret: 
slack:
        webhooks:
                incoming_url: 
```

You will need to signup to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/apis) and [Infura](https://infura.io/) to get your API keys.

Optional, a secret for `jwt_secret` can be generated by running `docker-compose run api rake secret`.

Spin up the app.
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Once all the services are finished building, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
